# Election Results
The Boulder County Elections [publishes](https://bouldercounty.gov/elections/by-year/) "statements of votes" for primary, general (even years), and coordinated (odd years) elections in going back to 2004. 

## Data notes
* General and primary elections since 2004 are available as Excel files
* Coordinated elections since 2013 are available as Excel files, 2011 has a PDF, and earlier are only aggregates without precinct-level results
* The formatting of these files is relatively consistent from 2014 onward
* Files before 2012 are poorly structured as data and require substantial cleaning
* PDFs will require extraction or manual entry
* Check consistency of precinct names
* Handling outcomes for multi-winner races (e.g., Boulder City Council)
